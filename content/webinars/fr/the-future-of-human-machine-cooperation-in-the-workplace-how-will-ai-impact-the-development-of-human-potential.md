abstract: "The increase in computing power has, in the last decade, led to
  significant improvements in AI technologies, including robotics, machine
  vision and speech recognition. According to several prominent thinkers that
  have discussed the future of work and automation, there are two main scenarios
  for how the development of AI in the workplace will impact labor markets: (1)
  replacing workers with machines; and (2) using machines to improve worker
  productivity."
