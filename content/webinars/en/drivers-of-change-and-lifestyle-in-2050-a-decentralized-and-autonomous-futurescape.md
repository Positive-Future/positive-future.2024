**Webinar broadcast on April 27th, 2021.**

The art and science of futures studies help us obtain a better understanding of the drivers of change by focusing on Long Term, Big Picture and Radical Change: for example, Tech Revolutions (Biohacking plus Artificial Intelligence), Social Upheavals (Massive Access to Free Education/Tools of Production), Business Disruptions (End of Banking), Major Transformations (Post Plastic Society). **Drivers of change are factors causing change, affecting or shaping the futures**.

In this webinar, Victor V. Motti will review some drivers of change such as data, clean energy, automation, green economy, and silver tsunami. He will also report from a global survey of experts on Society and Lifestyles in 2050. The expert sample of the survey was selected from authors of the articles in the leading futures and foresight journals. **This survey shows us how a decentralized and autonomous futurescape is emerging in areas such as consumption of food, manufactured goods, and infrastructure including housing and mobility.**
