  text: The Fondation 2100, under the aegis of the Fondation ParisTech, aims to promote
    the long-term foresight of human societies. It extends the work begun nearly forty
    years ago under the direction of Thierry Gaudin by the Centre de Prospective et
    d'Évaluation of the French Ministry for Research and then by the Prospective 2100
    NGO. Today, it fosters foresight efforts through a PhD thesis prize awarded with
    a circle of academics, a competition on positive futures in partnership with the
    Paris Institute for Advanced Study, and an international project on global foresight
    (updating the 2100, Narrative of the Next Century report, published in 1990).

  text: The Paris Institute for Advanced Study is an independent research center in
    the humanities and social sciences aiming at fostering collective intelligence
    through interdisciplinary research and the experimentation of new formats of intersectoral
    collaborations. It invites high-level international researchers for fellowships
    in residence in Paris, organizes scientific events, and sets up spaces for reflection
    and exchange involving academics, citizens, political decision-makers and businesses.

  text: The institute has two tasks, one of which is to conduct future studies, to
    promote a future-oriented perspective in Swedish research, and to use and develop
    appropriate theory and methodology. Our research is guided by research programs,
    and the current program includes research on climate change, new technologies,
    prejudices that govern our actions, who will make what decisions, and the well-being
    of our young. The researchers at the institute mainly conduct research in this
    program. Our second mission is to stimulate an open and broad discussion about
    possibilities and threats to future social development. We do this by organizing
    seminars, publishing reports and communicating research via newsletters, Facebook,
    Twitter and our site, but also by our researchers participating in debates, visiting
    politicians, government agencies and companies, and sharing their knowledge through
    public media.
