Work is constantly evolving. Companies and work organizations are constantly seeking new ways of working, new balances. In the face of so many challenges, what are the prospects for work in 2050? 

For this second edition, the Positive Future Competition aims to bring to light positive visions of work, i.e. scenarios that show how new issues can be tackled, and how solutions and forms of regulation can be identified. 

Participants are invited to reflect on tomorrow's challenges and build an original story around the theme of "Work in 2050".
