title: 2021 edition
theme: The City in 2100
---
This theme invited us to rethink our lifestyles and our urban spaces. What will the sustainable and pleasant city of tomorrow look like? What links to territories and rural spaces? Participants were invited to produce a story that would provide a credible and original vision of cities in 2100.

The jury paid attention to the story, the quality of the plot, and the formal implementation; but also and above al to the realistic nature of the background, the city in which people live.
