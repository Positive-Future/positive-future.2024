title: Our initiative
---
There are many representations of dystopian futures, depicting a frightening future that tends to discourage initiatives for change. Yet there is a lot of research and foresight work outlining positive, realistic alternatives for tomorrow's world.

The Positive Future initiative was launched by the [Institut d'études avancées de Paris](https://www.paris-iea.fr/en/) and the [Fondation 2100](https://2100.org/) to make the work of futurists widely known, with two objectives in mind:

* To help us think about a future that is not only liveable and desirable, but also realistic.
* To share positive and inspiring visions of the future.
