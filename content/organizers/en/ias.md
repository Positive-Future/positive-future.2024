The Paris Institute for Advanced Study is an independent research center in
the humanities and social sciences aiming at fostering collective intelligence
through interdisciplinary research and the experimentation of new formats of intersectoral
collaborations. It invites high-level international researchers for fellowships
in residence in Paris, organizes scientific events, and sets up spaces for reflection
and exchange involving academics, citizens, political decision-makers and businesses.
