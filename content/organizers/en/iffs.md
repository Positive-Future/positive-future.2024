The institute has two tasks, one of which is to conduct future studies, to
promote a future-oriented perspective in Swedish research, and to use and develop
appropriate theory and methodology. Our research is guided by research programs,
and the current program includes research on climate change, new technologies,
prejudices that govern our actions, who will make what decisions, and the well-being
of our young. The researchers at the institute mainly conduct research in this
program. Our second mission is to stimulate an open and broad discussion about
possibilities and threats to future social development. We do this by organizing
seminars, publishing reports and communicating research via newsletters, Facebook,
Twitter and our site, but also by our researchers participating in debates, visiting
politicians, government agencies and companies, and sharing their knowledge through
public media.
