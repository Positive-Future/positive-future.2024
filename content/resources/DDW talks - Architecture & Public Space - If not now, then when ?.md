  'Italian architect Francesca Cesa Bianchi mentioned the need for new
  criteria for creating and preserving public spaces in contemporary, densely populated
  cities. In her talk, Francesca, who works at Stefano Boeri Architetti, emphasised
  the need for green cities. She showed that urban planning can be perfectly balanced
  with nature. As an example she mentions Milan, where old train tracks have been
  developed into a green network through the city. The result: more biodiversity,
  places for recreation and more space for walkers and cyclists.'
