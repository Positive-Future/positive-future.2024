author: TEDx Talks
description_en: "Food Designer Chloé Rutzerveld is not impressed by the current 3D
  food printing hype in which the printers are basically being used as shaping machines
  to transform chocolate and sugar into fancy shapes. In her talk she shares her vision
  and explains how the combination of technology, design and science can lead to actual
  innovative, healthy and sustainable 3D printed food that has the ability to reduce
  the ecological footprint of man on earth.  \n\nChloé Rutzerveld is a Dutch food
  and concept designer who creates conceptual food products and interactive, experimental
  dinners. Recently, Chloé has used 3-D printers to create a selection of unique,
  tasty and healthy hors d’oeuvres, which are as beautiful to look at, as they are
  good to eat.  She uses food as a medium to address, communicate and discuss social
  and cultural issues.  Chloé’s passion for food and curiosity for nature are driving
  forces behind everything she does.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using
  the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn
