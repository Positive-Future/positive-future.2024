  'The Islais Hyper-Creek is a vision for the area where ecology and
  industry co-exist in harmony. A large park with a restored tidal creek system and
  soft shoreline that shares the area with maritime functions, light manufacturing,
  and logistics, that have existed in the place for decades. The park plays an important
  role in building physical and social resilience. '
