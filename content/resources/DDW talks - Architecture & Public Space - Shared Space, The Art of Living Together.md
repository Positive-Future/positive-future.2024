  "As Chief Government Architect, Floris Alkemade is leading when it
  comes to the architectural quality of government buildings. Doing so, he has developed
  a vision on major spatial themes. In his talk, Floris explained we carry a large
  responsibility when it comes to spatial design, as it determines how people live
  together. Thinking about the city of the future therefore not only concerns a city's
  physical design, but the underlying bigger question is: what kind of society do
  we want to create?"
