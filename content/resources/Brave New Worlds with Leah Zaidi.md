name: Brave New Worlds with Leah Zaidi
author: Leah Zaifi, Lisa Kay Solomon
description_en: "“Have you dreamt of other worlds? Another time, another place perhaps...universes
  of the mind so unlike our own. Is it because you grew tired of this one? Many of
  us have, at some point in our lives, asked if there is a time or place better than
  the one we find ourselves in — that this cannot be all that there is or the best
  that we can do.” - Leah Zaidi \n\nBut what if we stop seeking escape and start seeking
  change? What if we could learn from those who build the worlds we escape to, in
  order to create a better one for ourselves?There may be many possible worlds we
  prefer more than this one - worlds in which our systems are sustainable, and in
  which we are collectively better off."
