description_en: 'The global economy is affected by significant economic, technological
  and demographic changes that threaten to reduce decent work opportunities at a time
  when the demand for employment is growing, and economic inequalities are higher
  than ever. The main actors within the SSE share a set of common features that make
  them ideally suited to take on some of the key issues related to the future of work.
  They can help create and preserve employment in traditional sectors and promote
  decent work by providing quality and stable jobs, facilitating women’s entry into
  the labour force, integrating disadvantaged workers and helping the transition from
  informal to formal employment. '
