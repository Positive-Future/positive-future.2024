description_en: 'With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant changes
  within existing city structures (like urban spaces) have become even more noticeable,
  therefore reinforcing the demand for novel visions as well as (system) innovations
  for metropolitan areas. The Plenary Table “The Future of Work and Urban Planning:
  Designing Innovative Interventions” will pursue the answers to the questions: How
  can new concepts, as well as interventions for sustainable and resilient urban structures,
  be created? What will these solutions look like? The discussion will explore and
  further evaluate the potential of these transformative approaches regarding: the
  public sphere, social inclusion, community involvement in urban planning, governance,
  mobility and other aspects of public infrastructure.'
