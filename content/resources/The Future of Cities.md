  What does “the future of cities” mean? To much of the developing world,
  it might be as simple as aspiring to having your own toilet, rather than sharing
  one with over 100 people. To a family in Detroit, it could mean having non-toxic
  drinking water. For planners and mayors, it’s about a lot of things — sustainability,
  economy, inclusivity, and resilience. “The Future of a Cities” started as a collaboration
  with the The Nantucket Project, but it really took shape when hundreds of people
  around the world responded to a video made asking for help.
