author: Watson, Richard
description_en:
  'This map began as an idea way back in 2015, but it wasn’t until early
  2016 that Richard Watson started to draw various outlines. The sources included
  work done by the MOD GST (Global Strategic Trends to 2040), the US National Intelligence
  Council (NIC) report on 2030, the OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook
  2016, Shell Scenarios and various reports by PWC, EY, KPMG and McKinsey. 31 mega
  trends themes are represented on the map : population growth, urbanisation, globalisation,
  Easternisation, climate change, falling fertility, societal ageing ... The aim of
  this map is to spark some debate and make people think, especially about where we,
  as a world, might be heading.'
