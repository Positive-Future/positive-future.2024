title: Who are the referents and how are they chosen?
---

WPRN referents are senior scientists with vast experience; they operate *pro bono*for the benefit of the community. A [list of referents](https://wprn.org/referent_list) is published on the WPRN website. The International [Scientific Advisory board](https://wprn.org/advisory_board) validates admission to the WPRN communities of referents.
