title: What is expected from contributors?
---

Contributors should be straight to the point of what they are doing and what is the added value of their project. The abstract should be brief, informative and self-explanatory, very explicit about the problem addressed, the research question, the methodology, the data set, the team, and the expected outcome. A link can be provided to a webpage containing a more detailed description and material.WPRN is an edited global directory of projects, initiatives and resources that functions as an open platform open for all to browse: researchers, funders, governments, media, and the general public alike.

We have three type of contributors:

- **Project leaders** who register their project on WPRN, update it, receive alerts and offers for collaboration and funding.
- **Referents** who are aware of new projects in their domain, screen them, flag those they consider most innovative and interesting.
- **Partner institutions** that request their members to register projects, publish calls and fund projects, stamp their blazon on flagged projects, provide high-level scholars as referents.
