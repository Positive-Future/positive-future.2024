We do not track users or store any information outside of the project definition scope. A basic and anonymous browser fingerprint is stored only to estimate unique project views and improve our project ranking feature. We do not disclose or sell email addresses or any other personal information.

We do not use cookies except for those of [Google Recaptcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) in order to protect our forms against spam and abuse.
