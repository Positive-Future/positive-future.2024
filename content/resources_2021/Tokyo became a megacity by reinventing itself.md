name: Tokyo became a megacity by reinventing itself
author: National Geographic magazine
description_en: "If you agree with Harvard economist Edward Glaeser that cities are
  humanity’s greatest invention, then Tokyo is perhaps our greatest example: a stunning
  metropolis, home to more than 37 million people and one of the world’s wealthiest,
  safest, most creative urban centers. \nEven if you’re not particularly interested
  in how megacities shape human behavior, Tokyo is unavoidable—it has already changed
  your life. The city is the ultimate social influencer, the node through which the
  world connects to Japanese culture."
