description_en: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) sponsors Independent Task Forces
  to assess issues of current and critical importance to US foreign policy and provide
  policymakers with concrete judgments and recommendations. Diverse in backgrounds
  and perspectives, Task Force members aim to reach a meaningful consensus on policy
  through private deliberations. Once launched, Task Forces are independent of CFR
  and solely responsible for the content of their reports. This report focuses on
  how to rebuild the links among work, opportunity, and economic security for all
  in the face of accelerating change. It recommends the creation of new work opportunities,
  better career paths, and higher incomes, while developing a highly skilled and adaptable
  workforce.
