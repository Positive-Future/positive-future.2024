name: 'The End of Work : The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the
  Post-Market Era'
author: Jeremy Rifkin
description_en: 'Jeremy Rifkin argues that we are entering a new phase in history
  - one characterized by the steady and inevitable decline of jobs. The world is fast
  polarizing into two potentially irreconcilable forces: on one side, an information
  elite that controls and manages the high-tech global economy; and on the other,
  the growing numbers displaced workers, who have few prospects and little hope for
  meaningful employment in an increasingly automated world.The end of work could mean
  the demise of civilization as we have come to know it, or signal the beginning of
  a great social transformation and a rebirth of the human spirit.'
