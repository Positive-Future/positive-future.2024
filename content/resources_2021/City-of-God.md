author: Jáuregui, Jorge Mario
description_en: 'City of God, with a current population of 65,000, was born in the
  60’s as a “habitation solution” for the people who lived in favelas located in wealthy
  areas of Rio (like the “Lagoon”) and who were officially expelled to move to the
  periphery of the city, without services or urban infrastructure that could create
  any type of urbanity, with no preoccupation over the quality of life. All this,
  through the argument of “cleaning up” and “winning over” the spaces occupied by
  the favelas for the formal city, in which, regardless of some exceptions, they were
  open to real-estate speculation. '
