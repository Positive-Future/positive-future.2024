author: Osseo-Asare, D.
description_en: "Pioneering a grassroots circular economy.\nIn Agbogbloshie, a community
  in Accra, Ghana, people descend on a scrapyard to mine electronic waste for recyclable
  materials. Without formal training, these urban miners often teach themselves the
  workings of electronics by taking them apart and putting them together again. These
  self-taught techies can be the key to a growing maker community where people engage
  in peer-to-peer, hands-on education, motivated by what they want to create. "
