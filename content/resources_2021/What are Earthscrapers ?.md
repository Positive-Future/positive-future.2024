name: What are Earthscrapers ?
author: The B1M
description_en: What defines a earthscraper ? While countless structures are buried
  underground, such as car parks, arenas and laboratories these are not earthscrapers.
  Earthscrapers are best described as an inverted skyscraper. They start at ground
  level and then extend a considerable distance downwards from the surface. The best-known
  proposal to actually build an earthscraper was an entry to the Evolo Skyscraper
  Competition in 2012 by Mexican architectural practice BNKR Arquitectur. Their proposal
  imagines a 65-storey deep earthscraper placed beneath Mexico City’s central square,
  the Zócalo.
