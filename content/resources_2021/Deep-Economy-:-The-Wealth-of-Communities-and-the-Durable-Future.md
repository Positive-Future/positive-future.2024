name: 'Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future'
author: Mc Kibben, Bill
description_en: In this powerful and provocative manifesto, Bill McKibben offers the
  biggest challenge in a generation to the prevailing view of our economy. For the
  first time in human history, he observes, "more" is no longer synonymous with "better"—indeed,
  for many of us, they have become almost opposites. McKibben puts forward a new way
  to think about the things we buy, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the money
  that pays for it all. Our purchases, he says, need not be at odds with the things
  we truly value.
