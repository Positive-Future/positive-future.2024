name: 'Future cities : new challenges mean we need to reimagine the look of urban
  landscapes'
author: The Conversation
description_en: Imagining future cities has long been a favourite activity for architects,
  artists and designers. Technology is often central in these schemes – it appears
  as a dynamic and seemingly unstoppable force, providing a neat solution to society’s
  problems. But our recent research has suggested that we need to significantly rethink
  the way we imagine future cities, and move our focus from an overarching technological
  vision to other priorities, such as environmental sustainability and the need to
  tackle social inequalities. We need to answer questions about what can be sustained
  and what cannot, where cities can be located and where they cannot, and how we might
  travel in and between them.
