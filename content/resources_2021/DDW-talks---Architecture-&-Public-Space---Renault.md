description_en: As Senior Vice President Corporate Design at Groupe Renault, Laurens
  van den Acker shared his vision on the future of mobility in relation to shared
  and public spaces. As one of the ambassadors of DDW 2018, he envisioned a world
  in which 60 to 70 percent of the population is living in cities and where urbanisation
  is developing rapidly. In these cities, the distinction between public and personal
  transport will blur and Laurens foresees a prominent role for autonomous, electric
  vehicles
