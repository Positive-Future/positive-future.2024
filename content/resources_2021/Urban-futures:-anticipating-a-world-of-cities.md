author: 'Geci Karuri-Sebina,  Karel-Herman Haegeman,  Apiwat Ratanawaraha '
description_en: The speed, scale and scope of urbanisation in the past decades are
  unprecedented in world history, and the trend is expected to continue for some decades
  to come. In 2014, for the first time in history, more people lived in urban areas
  than in rural areas. This urbanisation trend is likely to continue, with the world
  urban population projected to grow from 54.5 per cent in 2014 to close to 70 per
  cent in 2050. So, it looks like the urban planet is here to stay. This growing realisation
  has made urban issues the increasing subject of interest across disciplines over
  recent decades
