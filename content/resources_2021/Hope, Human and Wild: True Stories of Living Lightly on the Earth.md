name: 'Hope, Human and Wild : True Stories of Living Lightly on the Earth'
author: Mc Kibben, Bill
description_en: Hope, Human and Wild sets out on a dramatically different journey
  to provide examples and hope for a sustainable future, one in which our society's
  wealth is measured less by its material productivity and more by its spiritual richness;
  less by its consumption of resources and more by the extent to which we live in
  harmony with the natural world. From the Adirondack Mountains to Kerala, India,
  to Curitiba, Brazil, McKibben offers clear-eyed and profoundly compelling portraits
  of places where resourceful people have confronted modern problems with inventive
  solutions, and thrived in the process. With an afterword by the author updating
  developments in the decade since the book was first published, this new edition
  offers a badly needed vision of optimism for the future of our planet.
