name: 'Urbanization and the evolution of cities across 10,000 years '
author: Kite, Vance
description_en: About 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers, aided by rudimentary agriculture,
  moved to semi-permanent villages and never looked back. With further developments
  came food surpluses, leading to commerce, specialization and, many years later with
  the Industrial Revolution, the modern city. Vance Kite plots our urban past and
  how we can expect future cities to adapt to our growing populations
